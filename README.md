# YouTube Video Engagement Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the performance of the YouTube videos I have created, specifically their engagement over time. By leveraging YouTubeâ€™s API, we will extract and analyze various video statistics such as views, watch time, audience retention, and engagement metrics. The goal is to understand the factors that influence viewer behavior, such as when they drop off or stay engaged throughout the video, and to identify patterns that can inform future video content creation.

## Motivation
As a content creator on YouTube, it is important to understand how my videos perform over time, which sections of videos retain viewers, and where people tend to lose interest. With this data, I can make data-driven decisions to improve my content, increase viewer engagement, and better target my audience. The insights from this analysis can help in:
- Tailoring video content to enhance viewer retention.
- Understanding the optimal video length and structure.
- Identifying trends that correlate with increased or decreased viewer interaction.

## Data Source
The data for this project is collected using:
1. **YouTube Data API v3**: Provides access to public video statistics such as views, likes, comments, and more.
2. **YouTube Analytics API**: Offers in-depth statistics on video performance, including audience retention and demographics.
3. **YouTube Studio**: An intuitive platform for tracking video performance metrics, such as:
   - Views, likes, comments, and watch time.
   - Audience retention data showing viewer drop-off points.
   - Traffic sources, demographics, and real-time data.

### Authentication
Authentication for both APIs is performed using **OAuth2.0 credentials**, ensuring secure access to private channel data.

## Dataset Description
The dataset includes the following types of data for each video:
- **Video ID**: Unique identifier for each video.
- **Views**: Total number of views.
- **Audience**: How many people watched the video over time.
- **Likes**: Number of likes received.
- **Comments**: Number of comments on the video.
- **Audience Retention**: Breakdown showing where viewers drop off in the video.
- **Watch Time**: Total time spent watching the video.
- **Engagement Metrics**: User interactions such as shares, likes, and comments.

## Data Analysis Techniques

### 1. Data Collection
- **API Integration**: Use the YouTube Data API v3 for public video data and the YouTube Analytics API for granular engagement details.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- **Cleaning and Structuring**: Remove irrelevant information and format the data for analysis.
- **Normalization**: Standardize metrics (e.g., views and likes) for better cross-video comparisons.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Trend Analysis**: Visualize video performance metrics (views, likes, watch time) over time.
- **Engagement Patterns**: Analyze where viewers drop off in videos using audience retention data.

### 4. Data Visualization
- **Time Series Plots**: Track changes in views and engagement over time.
- **Heatmaps**: Visualize audience retention and viewer drop-off points.
- **Scatter Plots**: Examine correlations between metrics like watch time and views.

## Project Plan
### Phase 1: Data Collection
- Set up API credentials and integrate the YouTube Data API and Analytics API.
- Retrieve video statistics and audience retention data.

### Phase 2: Data Preprocessing
- Clean and structure the collected data.
- Normalize and prepare the dataset for analysis.

### Phase 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Conduct preliminary analysis to identify trends and key metrics.
- Visualize video performance over time.

### Phase 4: Reporting and Visualization
- Create a final report summarizing findings, trends, and recommendations.
- Visualize insights through charts and graphs.
